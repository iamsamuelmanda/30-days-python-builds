# 30 Days of Building - Kabwe to the World

**Coder:** Samuel
**Location:** Kabwe, Zambia  
**Mission:** Build 30 real projects in 30 days
**Start Date:** November 7, 2025

## Why I'm Doing This
I want to build for Africa. Solar energy, data centers, solutions that matter. 
But first, I need to prove I can build ANYTHING.

This is my proof.

## Day 1: Passenger Poem ✓
**What it does:** Interactive poem about choice, agency, and building your own future  
**What I learned:** 
- while loops
- user input validation  
- Rebuilding after losing work (most important lesson)
- Why backups matter

**Tech:** Python, time module, conditionals, loops

*"You're not just a passenger. You're the architect of your flight."*

Day 2: Passenger 8 Poem (Interactive + Multi-Journey) ✓

What it does: Expands the original Passenger Poem into a living, replayable story where each new journey reveals more of the poet’s consciousness.

What I learned:

Nested loops and conditionals (while, if/elif/else)

Using time.sleep() for pacing and emotion

Dynamic variables (journey_count, user name reuse)

Managing flow with .lower() and validation

The art of rebuilding from memory — discipline forged through code loss


Tech: Python 3, time module, loops & conditionals

Wins:

Rebuilt from scratch and made it even better

Program now supports multiple journeys

Learned resilience through error recovery

Code backed up successfully to GitHub

✨ “Every Passenger carries a story — but you, the builder, pilot your own.”

## Day 3: Forex Profit/Loss Calculator ✓
**Date:** November 16, 2025  
**Build time:** ~6 hours (with debugging)

**What it does:** 
Calculates profit/loss for forex trades supporting both long and short positions with unlimited calculations in one session.

**What I learned:**
- Functions: def, parameters, return
- Mathematical operations for forex
- If/elif/else for different trade types
- While loops for repeated actions
- String formatting with .2f for currency
- Debugging indentation errors
- Breaking down problems into smaller parts

**Features:**
- Long and short position support
- Pip-based calculations
- Clean formatted output with profit/loss indicators
- Multiple trade calculations without restart
- Input validation

**Challenges overcome:**
- Tab vs space indentation (learned to use spaces only)
- Understanding function structure
- Proper nesting of if statements inside loops
