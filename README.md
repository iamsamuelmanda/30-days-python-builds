# 30 Days of Building - Kabwe to the World

**Coder:** Samuel
**Location:** Kabwe, Zambia  
**Mission:** Build 30 real projects in 30 days
**Start Date:** November 7, 2025

## Why I'm Doing This
I want to build for Africa. Solar energy, data centers, solutions that matter. 
But first, I need to prove I can build ANYTHING.

This is my proof.

## Day 1: Passenger Poem ✓
**What it does:** Interactive poem about choice, agency, and building your own future  
**What I learned:** 
- while loops
- user input validation  
- Rebuilding after losing work (most important lesson)
- Why backups matter

**Tech:** Python, time module, conditionals, loops

*"You're not just a passenger. You're the architect of your flight."*

Day 2: Passenger 8 Poem (Interactive + Multi-Journey) ✓

What it does: Expands the original Passenger Poem into a living, replayable story where each new journey reveals more of the poet’s consciousness.

What I learned:

Nested loops and conditionals (while, if/elif/else)

Using time.sleep() for pacing and emotion

Dynamic variables (journey_count, user name reuse)

Managing flow with .lower() and validation

The art of rebuilding from memory — discipline forged through code loss


Tech: Python 3, time module, loops & conditionals

Wins:

Rebuilt from scratch and made it even better

Program now supports multiple journeys

Learned resilience through error recovery

Code backed up successfully to GitHub

✨ “Every Passenger carries a story — but you, the builder, pilot your own.”
